# goop

Goop is a transpiler from goo code to go code
Currently Goop is in an early alpha state that has some stable functionality present but is largely hacked together rather than following good design principles for lexing code

#What is goo code?

Goo is an object-oriented extension of go (golang)
Essentially, the features and principles of golang are unchanged. Goo just provides an alternate syntax to work with objects to promote readability, code abstraction, and familiarity for people used to pure OO languages
